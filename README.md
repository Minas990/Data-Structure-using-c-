1-The sorting techniques in this file:
  1.1. Bubble sort
  1.2. Selection sort
  1.3. Insertion sort
  1.4. Merge sort
  1.5. Shell sort

2- In "Stacks, linked lists, and solutions to some problems related to these two files," there are several problems associated with these topics such as:
  Infix to postfix conversion
  Infix to prefix conversion
  Evaluating expressions using stacks
  Reversing linked lists, and more.
  
3- Tree.cpp file:
  It's not a binary tree but rather each node has a list of pointers pointing to its children.

4- The iterator in AVL tree is inorder, in BST it is preorder.

5-Why not separate the header file from the implementation: 
  Consider it as an exercise for you! <3
